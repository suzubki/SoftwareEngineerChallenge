Follow these design rules:

- Always use the @acme/ui package for all UI components.
- Prefer using flex over grid. For flex-row or flex-col, we use custom components like Split and Stack, where Split is flex items-center and Stack is flex flex-col. Don't use <div className="flex">, etc. Instead, use Split and Stack.
